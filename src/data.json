      "text": "<h2 id=\"beginnings-in-software-development\">Beginnings in Software Development</h2> <p>My journey as a software developer began in late 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 lockdown. With fewer school assignments, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in computers and programming. After countless hours of watching <a href=\"https://unity.com/\">Unity</a> tutorials, I began to grasp the basic concepts of programming. My first projects were algorithmic in nature, but my desire to understand computers deeply led me to explore <code>MS DOS</code> programming. In April 2021, just before my high school entrance exams, I completed my first project in <code>BASIC</code>, a game called <a href=\"https://github.com/branislavjuhas/gasbag\"><strong>Gasbag</strong></a>.</p> <div> <img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/FKc7MS5d/Retro.jpg\" alt=\"Retro Workspace\"> <img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/FHwYCZqX/Gasbag.png\" alt=\"Gasbag\"> </div> <h2 id=\"unity-and-mobile-game-development\">Unity and Mobile Game Development</h2> <p>In the summer of 2021, I decided to broaden my horizons. Using <a href=\"https://unity.com/\">Unity</a>, I transformed <a href=\"https://github.com/branislavjuhas/gasbag\"><strong>Gasbag</strong></a> into a mobile game and published it on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/\">Google Play</a>. Unfortunately, due to a lack of maintenance and compatibility issues with the rapidly evolving Android market, the game was removed from the Play Store two years later.</p> <h2 id=\"microcontroller-projects-with-arduino\">Microcontroller Projects with Arduino</h2> <p>During my exploration of the world of computers, I ventured into the realm of microcontrollers. I created several mini-projects, including a Morse code emitter and a keyboard for the <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/\">Arduino</a> platform, before the end of the year.</p> <h2 id=\"corporate-experience-and-vba\">Corporate Experience and VBA</h2> <p>In summer 2022, I entered the corporate world. My experience with manufacturing processes led me to work with <code>Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)</code>. After successfully creating a few smaller macros, I was tasked with larger projects, such as developing planning checklists for the construction and research departments of a corporation. In late 2022, I optimized data management processes for the Quality department by creating <strong>Henkel</strong> software using <code>C#</code> and Terminal.Gui. This software not only registered faults and exported them but also featured simple AI algorithms to classify user input.</p> <div> <img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/cH2krPk5/Henkel.png\" alt=\"Henkel\"> <img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/26VXjCGZ/Krauss-Maffei.jpg\" alt=\"Office\"> </div> <h2 id=\"advancing-with-winui-3\">Advancing with WinUI 3</h2> <p>Tired of both C# console templates and obsolete WinForms platforms, I shifted my focus to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/\">WinUI 3</a> in the spring of 2023. My first experience with this framework came while upgrading <strong>Henkel</strong> with a more user-friendly interface. This led to the development of <code>HVDAPT (Henkel Vision Design Approach Prototype)</code>. After two complete rewrites of the codebase, the project evolved into <a href=\"https://github.com/branislavjuhas/dn-henkel-vision\"><strong>DN Henkel Vision</strong></a>. With official support from <a href=\"https://www.kraussmaffei.com/en/home\">KraussMaffei Corporation</a>, the first release was shipped. The final version featured a visually appealing interface and an advanced AI for accurate classification, built using the <a href=\"https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet/model-builder\">ML.NET Model Builder</a>.</p> <h2 id=\"establishing-dn-software-heritage\">Establishing DN Software Heritage</h2> <p>As my portfolio of projects grew, I felt the need to create a common foundation for all my work. On April 3rd, 2023, I founded the <strong>DN Software Heritage</strong> to preserve and honor the legacy and work of the great. Almost a year later, the foundation was renamed <a href=\"https://juhaas.eu/dn\">DN Family</a> for marketing purposes, though older projects may still reflect the original name in their codebase.</p> <h2 id=\"web-development-and-modern-frameworks\">Web Development and Modern Frameworks</h2> <p>In 2024, I focused on enhancing my web development skills. Initially, I explored <code>PHP</code> while creating the official e-shop for the student company where I served as president. Upon joining the Slovak Debate Association&#39;s IT committee as the lead software developer, I delved into the <a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\">Django</a> framework to develop a backend for the association&#39;s registration software. Later, I transitioned to working with the <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue</a> framework and <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/\">Firebase</a> backend, which significantly accelerated the development process. The knowledge gained during this period was instrumental in building the website you are visiting now.</p> <h2 id=\"mastery-of-various-technologies\">Mastery of Various Technologies</h2> <p>Throughout my career as a software developer, I have worked on numerous smaller projects, honing my skills in various programming languages. I am now proficient in <code>C#</code> and <code>XML</code> and fluent in <code>Python</code>, <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>HTML</code>, and <code>Visual Basic</code>. I have a deep understanding of <code>Java</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>C++</code>, and even <code>x86</code> and <code>6502 assembly</code> language and machine code.</p> <h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2> <p>My journey as a software developer has been diverse and enriching, leading me to explore various technologies and frameworks. Each project has contributed to my growth and expertise, shaping me into a versatile and skilled developer.</p>"

The first season provided a great opportunity to improve my debate skills across multiple tournaments, all of which were held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Competing against more experienced teams gave me a valuable chance to challenge and enhance my abilities.</p> <h2 id=\"leadership-in-debate\">Leadership in Debate</h2> <p>After the initial year, along with two other beginners, I was chosen to present debate to the new first-year students at our school to spark their interest in the activity. Following this event, I switched debate teams and began debating with Barbora Svitková, who has been my faithful colleague ever since. In the following season, we won three out of five tournaments, and I reached the semi-finals at the national debate league finals. The 2023/2024 season was a remarkable journey to victory. After successful regional rounds, we qualified for the nationwide finals as the top team in our region. Despite facing strong competition, we secured the overall victory in the grand finale of the debate league. Alongside the title of two-time winner of the GJH Open, I also earned the title of the 2024 Master of the Slovak Republic in academic debate.</p> <div> <img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/52qLwnLs/Suvar.webp\" alt=\"FSDL 2024\"> <img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/Mp81MhMc/Announcement.webp\" alt=\"Announcement\"> </div> <h2 id=\"competing-at-university-level\">Competing at University Level</h2> <p>Seeking equal competition, I attended several university tournaments, where I had the chance to debate against university students and other high school graduates. I excelled at these events and experienced the peak of my career at the 2023 Academic Championships of the Czech and Slovak Republics. I qualified for the elimination rounds in second place and, after successful semi-finals, had the opportunity to debate in the prestigious final. Together with my teammate, we earned the unofficial title of the best team under 20.</p> <h2 id=\"coaching-and-adjudication\">Coaching and Adjudication</h2> <p>Since 2023, I have been serving as a debate coach at Sučany, the largest and oldest debate club in the Slovak Republic. Additionally, I hold the prestigious first-degree adjudicator credential and was one of the most active adjudicators during the 2022/2023 season. Beyond adjudication, I was responsible for preparing the tabbing for debates and demonstrated strong logistical skills.</p> <div> <img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/k45ZbTYS/Club.webp\" alt=\"DK Sučany\"> <img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/g0sQjCsd/Ribbon.webp\" alt=\"Ribbon Ceremony\"> </div> <h2 id=\"the-value-of-debate\">The Value of Debate</h2> <p>For me, the most rewarding aspect of debate is its ability to teach critical and logical thinking, which can be linked with relevant experiences and real-life information. This skillset has not only enhanced my debating abilities but also enriched various aspects of my personal and academic life.</p>"
