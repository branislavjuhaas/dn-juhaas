## Introduction to Debate

My first experience with debating occurred in October 2021 after joining the Sučany debate club. The first season provided a great opportunity to improve my debate skills across multiple tournaments, all of which were held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Competing against more experienced teams gave me a valuable chance to challenge and enhance my abilities.

## Leadership in Debate

After the initial year, along with two other beginners, I was chosen to present debate to the new first-year students at our school to spark their interest in the activity. Following this event, I switched debate teams and began debating with Barbora Svitková, who has been my faithful colleague ever since. In the following season, we won three out of five tournaments, and I reached the semi-finals at the national debate league finals. The 2023/2024 season was a remarkable journey to victory. After successful regional rounds, we qualified for the nationwide finals as the top team in our region. Despite facing strong competition, we secured the overall victory in the grand finale of the debate league. Alongside the title of two-time winner of the GJH Open, I also earned the title of the 2024 Master of the Slovak Republic in academic debate.

## Competing at University Level

Seeking equal competition, I attended several university tournaments, where I had the chance to debate against university students and other high school graduates. I excelled at these events and experienced the peak of my career at the 2023 Academic Championships of the Czech and Slovak Republics. I qualified for the elimination rounds in second place and, after successful semi-finals, had the opportunity to debate in the prestigious final. Together with my teammate, we earned the unofficial title of the best team under 20.

## Coaching and Adjudication

Since 2023, I have been serving as a debate coach at Sučany, the largest and oldest debate club in the Slovak Republic. Additionally, I hold the prestigious first-degree adjudicator credential and was one of the most active adjudicators during the 2022/2023 season. Beyond adjudication, I was responsible for preparing the tabbing for debates and demonstrated strong logistical skills.

## The Value of Debate

For me, the most rewarding aspect of debate is its ability to teach critical and logical thinking, which can be linked with relevant experiences and real-life information. This skillset has not only enhanced my debating abilities but also enriched various aspects of my personal and academic life.
