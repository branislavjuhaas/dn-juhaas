# Skills and Development

## Beginnings in Software Development

My journey as a software developer began in late 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 lockdown. With fewer school assignments, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in computers and programming. After countless hours of watching [Unity](https://unity.com/) tutorials, I began to grasp the basic concepts of programming. My first projects were algorithmic in nature, but my desire to understand computers deeply led me to explore `MS DOS` programming. In April 2021, just before my high school entrance exams, I completed my first project in `BASIC`, a game called [**Gasbag**](https://github.com/branislavjuhas/gasbag).

## Unity and Mobile Game Development

In the summer of 2021, I decided to broaden my horizons. Using [Unity](https://unity.com/), I transformed [**Gasbag**](https://github.com/branislavjuhas/gasbag) into a mobile game and published it on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/). Unfortunately, due to a lack of maintenance and compatibility issues with the rapidly evolving Android market, the game was removed from the Play Store two years later.

## Microcontroller Projects with Arduino

During my exploration of the world of computers, I ventured into the realm of microcontrollers. I created several mini-projects, including a Morse code emitter and a keyboard for the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) platform, before the end of the year.

## Corporate Experience and VBA

In summer 2022, I entered the corporate world. My experience with manufacturing processes led me to work with `Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)`. After successfully creating a few smaller macros, I was tasked with larger projects, such as developing planning checklists for the construction and research departments of a corporation. In late 2022, I optimized data management processes for the Quality department by creating **Henkel** software using `C#` and Terminal.Gui. This software not only registered faults and exported them but also featured simple AI algorithms to classify user input.

## Advancing with WinUI 3

Tired of both C# console templates and obsolete WinForms platforms, I shifted my focus to [WinUI 3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/) in the spring of 2023. My first experience with this framework came while upgrading **Henkel** with a more user-friendly interface. This led to the development of `HVDAPT (Henkel Vision Design Approach Prototype)`. After two complete rewrites of the codebase, the project evolved into [**DN Henkel Vision**](https://github.com/branislavjuhas/dn-henkel-vision). With official support from [KraussMaffei Corporation](https://www.kraussmaffei.com/en/home), the first release was shipped. The final version featured a visually appealing interface and an advanced AI for accurate classification, built using the [ML.NET Model Builder](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet/model-builder).

## Establishing DN Software Heritage

As my portfolio of projects grew, I felt the need to create a common foundation for all my work. On April 3rd, 2023, I founded the **DN Software Heritage** to preserve and honor the legacy and work of the great. Almost a year later, the foundation was renamed [DN Family](https://juhaas.eu/dn) for marketing purposes, though older projects may still reflect the original name in their codebase.

## Web Development and Modern Frameworks

In 2024, I focused on enhancing my web development skills. Initially, I explored `PHP` while creating the official e-shop for the student company where I served as president. Upon joining the Slovak Debate Association's IT committee as the lead software developer, I delved into the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework to develop a backend for the association's registration software. Later, I transitioned to working with the [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) framework and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) backend, which significantly accelerated the development process. The knowledge gained during this period was instrumental in building the website you are visiting now.

## Mastery of Various Technologies

Throughout my career as a software developer, I have worked on numerous smaller projects, honing my skills in various programming languages. I am now proficient in `C#` and `XML` and fluent in `Python`, `JavaScript`, `HTML`, and `Visual Basic`. I have a deep understanding of `Java`, `C`, `C++`, and even `x86` and `6502 assembly` language and machine code.

## Conclusion

My journey as a software developer has been diverse and enriching, leading me to explore various technologies and frameworks. Each project has contributed to my growth and expertise, shaping me into a versatile and skilled developer.
